# Bryce Taylor

## About Me
I am a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University–Idaho with a growing interest in information technology, networking, and cybersecurity. I enjoy learning how systems work, solving technical problems, and building a strong foundation in modern technologies. My background in fast-paced customer-service roles taught me reliability, communication, and attention to detail—skills that translate directly into IT environments.

I am working to build experience through hands-on learning, coursework, and personal projects while developing the technical skills needed for entry-level IT, help desk, or cybersecurity roles. I am motivated by continuous improvement and enjoy exploring tools, labs, and projects that help me become a more capable technician.
